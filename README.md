## Usage
e.g. Lint => Test => Publish (only tagged) => slack (only if any job fails)
```yaml
on: push

name: CI

jobs:
  lint:
    name: ESLint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ...

  test:
    name: Coverage
    needs: lint
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ['11', '12']
    ...

  publish:
    name: Publish Package
    needs: test
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
    ...

  slack:
    name: Slack
    needs: publish # set "needs" only last job except this job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: always() # set "always"
    steps:
        # run this action to get the workflow conclusion
        # You can get the conclusion via env (env.WORKFLOW_CONCLUSION)
      - uses: technote-space/workflow-conclusion-action@v3

        # run other action with the workflow conclusion
      - uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
        with:
          # status: ${{ env.WORKFLOW_CONCLUSION }} # neutral, success, skipped, cancelled, timed_out, action_required, failure
          status: failure
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
        if: env.WORKFLOW_CONCLUSION == 'failure' # notify only if failure
```
